# Sheep-Face-Classification

Monitoring for sheep species identification and classification in the farming environment may prove tedious and could be a significant workload for a starting farmer.


Here, Convolutional Neural Network is proposed to reduce the workload of sheep farmers.

This experiment compares which neural architecture model is more valuable to classify sheep species based on its face.

The experiment was conducted using the training dataset obtained from Kaggle. The dataset contains 420 of each Marino sheep, Suffolk sheep, White Suffolk sheep.

Total of 1260 images are there.

Other Detail:

This project has been developed by Abhiroop Sarkar for the purpose of institutional project. Further Model Deployement is on process.

Dataset can be shared on requirement basis for educational purpose only. Candidate with requirement can mail a by mentioning the designation and current role with proper identity card in attachment.

Thank You, Have a Nice Day!
